With this report, we aim to provide a ML model capable of determining, based on images, whether a solid is dissolved in a specific solvent  in a fully automated way. We try via this project to emphasize its immediate practical application in a prototype laboratory automated such a SwissCAT+ for example, present at EPFL. A setup build with a Raspberry PI was used to take images from the top of the sample with a bottom light to increase the contrast.

Pretrained transfer learning models from Keras are used in this report to perform a binary classification task. 3 model were used to compare their defferent efficiency for this specific task. All three codes are build the same, only the model called in the code is different, the three models are: Xception, VGG16 and EfficientNetB7.

These pre-trained model is already capable of differentiating between two specific categories, thanks to the extensive dataset it was originally trained on. To adapt it to our needs, we simply add our own data on top and fine-tune the model. This way, we leverage the knowledge the model has already acquired, allowing us to achieve precise and efficient results without having to train a completely new model from scratch. For our specific task, we need to separate our images into two groups: dissolved and non-dissolved, labeling them distinctly. The Xception model has proven to be the most effective and suitable for the task at hand.

The folder detection_ml is composed of the 3 transfer learning model files called "transfer_learning_...py" with the name of the model mentionned before that replace the 3 dot. an other "img_preprocessing.py" file is present and used to cropped and change the colors of the images into shades of gray before using the modele.
